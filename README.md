# Lutron Caseta Integration for NEEO Thinking Remote

This plugin will allow your NEEO Brain to communicate with the Lutron SmartBridge for Caseta Lights. It will find your SmartBridge via Bonjour on you local network.

NPM Dependencies
- SSH2
- Bluebird
- util
- split
- bonjour
- neeo-sdk

Shout out to:

For the starting point to this application, without the SSH key we would never had had access to the SmartBridge, since its a closed system.

Looking for help on Lamp Dimmer, I do not own one so not sure what it shows up as in the devices call.
